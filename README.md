This is a script that creates a skeleton for an web development project.

The command is `htmlsetup.sh <projectname>` and it will make the requisite folders and HTML boilerplate code to index.html

For smaller projects/testing and only a standalone HTML document is desired, simply run `html.sh <filename>` and <filename>.html will be made with boilerplate code included.
